//GOAT: Internal Discussion: What do we ultimately want this API to look like?
//
// * Firstly, we probably ought to make a writable trait, in the vein of `ZipperSubtries` that allows
// merkleization on any object that has a mutable trie node (PathMaps, WriteZippers, etc.)
// I've wanted that anyway for a while because I felt like a lot of the API between ZipperWriting and
// PathMap should be merged together.
//
// * Secondly, I think we ought to allow the client to exfiltrate and store the `memo`, wrapped in some
// kind of black box.  That way, they could perform "gradual merkleization", as an opportunistic background
// process.
//
// However, the `memo` is liable to get huge in real-world situations, therefore we also want some kind of
// way to implement a heuristic to evict nodes that are unlikely to be duplicated.  I'm not totally sure what
// that heuristic(s) would be.  My first guess would be to try an LRU cache, but also, higher nodes are less
// likely to be identical, but also we get more "bang" if we find higher-level sharing.  So perhaps finding
// a that's shared means we make sure its parents are refreshed into the cache...  Anyway, gotta try stuff
// and measure.
//
// One additional consideration if we go the persistent memo route is that the very existence of the memo
// structure, under the present implementation, would increase the node refcounts and lead to copying... So
// we might want to explore something like a "weak" pointer to keep in the memo (semantics wouldn't be exactly
// the same as an Rc `weak`, but a similar idea)

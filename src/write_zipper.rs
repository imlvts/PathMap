    // / be deleted at the earliest opportunity.
    // /
    // / This temporary impl that treats read zippers the same as write zippers is needed on account of
    // / the fact that a read_zipper holds a reference to the root value, which lives in the parent node.
    // / However that node can be upgraded as part of a ZipperHead operation, to make a rooting site for
    // / another upstream zipper.  This unfortunately means we have no choice but to make the parent node
    // / into a CellNode, until we can change this unfortunate fact, by implementing the proposal in:
    // / [A.0001_map_root_values.md], Alternative 2.
    // /
    // / To head off the question: "Why not just clone ODRc reference the root into the read zipper" (I
    // / went part way down this implementation path myself), the answer is that some ReadZipper methods
    // / return borrows in the `'trie` lifetime, so the zipper can be dropped without invalidating the

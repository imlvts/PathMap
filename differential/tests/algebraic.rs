//! Regression gate for the algebraic equivalence fuzzer.
//!
//! Three things, cheap enough for `cargo test`:
//!
//! * the committed corpus still reproduces only what `KNOWN` documents;
//! * a short random sweep from a fixed seed turns up nothing new;
//! * the expression recognisers that decide which route applies to which shape
//!   agree with what the n-ary and DNF entry points actually compute.
//!
//! The last one is not incidental.  Both recognisers were wrong when this
//! fuzzer was first run, and both failures looked exactly like crate defects:
//! flattening `a ^ (b ^ c)` into the n-ary call, which folds values left, and
//! letting a DNF clause stand for `b & a` when a clause is an unordered set and
//! `pmeet` is left-biased.  A harness that reports its own mistakes as findings
//! is worse than no harness, so the recognisers are pinned here.

//! Differential trace producer with an `ArenaCompactTree` as the read source.
//!
//!     act_trace <input-file>          # or read the bytes from stdin
//!     act_trace --check <input-file>  # also assert the structural invariants
//!
//! Same wire format, same operation table and same trace format as
//! `pathmap_trace`; the only difference is that the read side is an ACT built
//! from map1 rather than the `PathMap` itself.  The Lean model produces the
//! matching trace with `pathmap-oracle --act`, which skips the operations ACT
//! cannot serve.
//!
//! What this exercises:
//!
//!   * `ArenaCompactTree::from_zipper` -- the final `MAP1` line is dumped from
//!     the ACT, so the round trip through the arena format is compared against
//!     the model's view of the source trie, dangling paths and root value
//!     included.
//!   * every read, movement and iteration operation on `ACTZipper`, against the
//!     same specification the `PathMap` read zipper is held to.
//!
//! What it cannot exercise: ACT is read-only and, more restrictively, is not a
//! `ZipperInfallibleSubtries`, so it cannot be the *source* of a graft or an
//! algebraic merge.  Those operations report `skip`.  ACT's own merge path is
//! `ArenaCompactTree::merge_zipper_into_file`, which `act_merge_check` covers.

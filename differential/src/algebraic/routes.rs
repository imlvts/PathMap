//! The different ways to compute the same thing.
//!
//! `pathmap` offers each algebraic operation several times over: once eagerly
//! on whole maps, once in place through a write zipper, once as a lockstep
//! traversal of two read zippers, and -- for the associative ones -- again as
//! an n-ary traversal, a DNF evaluator, and a lazy zipper over a virtual trie.
//! Those are not alternative spellings of one implementation; they are separate
//! implementations with separate pruning, grafting and value-combining logic,
//! which is exactly why they are worth running against each other.
//!
//! A *route* is one consistent way to evaluate a whole expression.  There are
//! two kinds:
//!
//! * **pointwise** routes walk the expression bottom-up and evaluate each node
//!   with a two-operand call, materialising each intermediate into a trie.
//!   Route `k` picks strategy `k % n` for an operator with `n` strategies, so
//!   every strategy is covered by some route and the routes mix them.
//! * **whole-expression** routes recognise a shape -- a chain of one
//!   associative operator, or a join of meets -- and hand the entire thing to
//!   one call that does it in a single traversal.  These are the routes with
//!   real independence from the pointwise ones: no intermediate trie is ever
//!   built, so they exercise code the pointwise routes never reach.
//!
//! Every route must produce the same trie.  `shape.rs` says what "same" means
//! and why dangling-path divergence is reported separately.

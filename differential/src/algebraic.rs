//! Equivalence fuzzer for the algebraic operations.
//!
//! The other two fuzzers in this crate ask *is the answer right?* -- the Lean
//! model in `../lean` is an oracle, and `bin/pathmap_trace.rs` is diffed
//! against it.  This one asks a different question: **does it matter which way
//! you compute it?**  It should not, and `pathmap` offers enough different ways
//! that the question has teeth.
//!
//! Each case is one algebraic expression over a few generated operand tries,
//! evaluated by every route in `routes.rs` that applies to it -- eagerly on
//! whole maps, in place through a write zipper, as a lockstep traversal of two
//! read zippers, as a single n-ary traversal, through the DNF engine, through a
//! lazy `OverlayZipper` over a virtual trie, as a `pathmap::fuse` program over
//! trie nodes below the zipper layer, and over a flat `BTreeMap` with no trie at
//! all.  Then `laws.rs` evaluates pairs of expressions that must agree whatever
//! the operands, which catches the mistakes every route shares.
//!
//! No Lean build is needed and there is no oracle: a divergence says the
//! implementations disagree, not which one is wrong.
//!
//! The wire format here is **not** the one `harness.rs` shares with
//! `PathMapModel.Fuzz`; this fuzzer has no model to stay in step with, so its
//! inputs are free to be whatever generates interesting tries.  It does reuse
//! `harness::Dec` for byte decoding.
//!
//! See `../ALGEBRAIC_FUZZING.md`.

/// 1. **Value bias by node layout** (`bias`).  `pjoin` on `u64` is
///    `left_biased_pjoin` and `pmeet` is `Identity(SELF_IDENT)`, so where both
///    operands carry a value the *left* one must win.  `PathMap::join` and
///    `PathMap::meet` take the right one when the two operands' nodes are laid
///    out differently -- in the reproducer, because one side has a chain of
///    dangling descendants below the shared path.  Every zipper route gets this
///    right, so it shows up as *laws* failing and as the `model` route
///    disagreeing, not as one route out of step with the others: the defect is
///    in the baseline the others are compared against.
///
/// 2. **`join` loses a value across shared structure** (`loss`).  With `b` a
///    clone of `a` plus one extra value, `a | b` drops that value and `b | a`
///    keeps it.  A join is a least upper bound, so no ordering may lose a path;
///    this is the one finding that needs no argument about value bias.  It
///    needs the operands to *share nodes* -- rebuilding `b`'s entries into a
///    fresh map makes it go away -- which is why the generator clones and
///    merkleizes operands instead of only writing them fresh.
///
/// 3. **Root values lost by the write-zipper forms** (`root`).  `join_into`
///    into an empty destination drops the source's root value, and `meet_2`
///    drops root values outright.  These are routes disagreeing with the
///    baseline in the ordinary way.
///
/// 4. **Dangling paths** (`dangling`).  Routes that graft whole subtries keep
///    structure that routes walking path by path do not.  Unsettled rather than
///    wrong -- see `../SPEC_WARTS.md` -- hence its own class, `shape`, which
///    does not fail a run unless `--shape` says so.
///
/// 5. **`merkleize` panics on dangling-only structure** (`merkleize`).  Not an
///    algebraic defect: it fires while the operands are still being written,
///    before any operation runs, which is what the `build` in its signature

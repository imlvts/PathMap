"""Differential runner: two implementations of the same specification.

For each input file, runs the Lean oracle and one other front end, and diffs the
traces.  All of them decode the same bytes with the same rules; see
`lean/PathMapModel/Fuzz.lean` for the wire format.

    lean/.lake/build/bin/pathmap-oracle     the Lean model  (always)
    target/*/pathmap_trace                 the real crate  (default)
    target/*/act_trace                     ACT read source (--act)

Each child is spawned once with `--server` and stays resident, taking inputs as
`run-input <timeout-ms> <hex>` on stdin; see `differential/src/server.rs` for the
protocol.  That replaced a temp file and two fresh processes per input, which
cost about 5x the runtime and left `/tmp/pathmap-diff-*` behind forever.  Only a
*failing* input is written to disk now, so it can still be replayed and shrunk.

    Spawning a process per input dominated the old runtime — 200 inputs spent
    more time in `sys` (fork/exec) than in `user` — so each front end now stays
    up and takes work as `run-input <timeout-ms> <hex>`, replying with the trace
    and one `!`-prefixed terminator.  See `differential/src/server.rs`.

    Two failure modes have to be survivable, because a wedged or dead child must
    not take the run with it:

    * the child stops answering (the Rust front ends cut their own work off with
      a thread timeout, but the oracle cannot -- see lean/Main.lean);
    * the child dies outright (an abort or a stack overflow unwinding cannot
      catch), which shows up as EOF.

    Either way the child is killed and respawned, and the input is reported as a
    timeout or a crash rather than silently skewing the comparison.

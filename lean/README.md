# A Lean model of the `pathmap` zipper

An executable formal specification of `pathmap`'s trie and zipper API, written
in Lean 4, plus the harness that uses it as an oracle for differential fuzzing
of the real crate.

Two things live here:

1. **The model** (`PathMapModel/`) — a total, executable definition of what each
   API function *means*, with the laws relating them.
2. **The harness** (`Main.lean`, `differential.py`, `shrink.py`, and the
   `../differential` crate) — the machinery that runs the same generated
   program against the model and against `pathmap`, and diffs the results.

Everything the fuzzing found is written up in [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md), with
standalone reproducers in `cargo run -p differential --bin zipper_bug_repros`.

## Build and run

Lean is installed through `elan`, which reads `lean-toolchain` and fetches the
pinned version (`leanprover/lean4:v4.33.1`, ~300 MB) on the first build.  The
model has no package dependencies.

```bash
curl https://elan.lean-lang.org/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh   # or: brew install elan-init
source ~/.elan/env
```

```bash
# the model, its build-time law checks, and the oracle binary
cd lean && lake build

# the crate side of the differential harness
cargo build --release -p differential

# generate random programs and compare model against crate
./lean/differential.py --random 500 --seed 1

# minimise an input that diverges (or that panics)
./lean/shrink.py path/to/input.bin
```

`lake build` also checks every `#guard` in `PathMapModel/Check.lean`, so a build
failure there means a law or a regression fixture broke.

## Why a model rather than more property tests

A property test asserts things you already suspect.  A model asserts *everything*
at once: for each generated program the harness compares every return value and
the entire resulting trie against what the specification says should happen.  The
interesting consequence is that writing the model is where most of the value was
— several defects in [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) were found by trying to state
the semantics precisely and discovering there was no consistent statement to
make, before a single fuzz input had been generated.

## The model is not a trie

Worth stating plainly, because the name would otherwise mislead: a trie is a
prefix tree, and this model is a flat list of `(path, value?)` pairs.  It is not
one, and does not try to be.

The model specifies the *meaning* a trie carries, not the trie.  Shaped like the
implementation, it would inherit the implementation's structure — and a bug in
how that structure is handled could then be present in both and cancel out.
Findings 14, 15 and 16 are all bugs of exactly that kind (an invalid node built
by `graft`, a dense-node path in `graft_child_maps`, empty nodes in the sharing
machinery), and the model catches them precisely because it has no nodes to get
wrong.  The type is named `PathMap`, after the crate's own name for the thing a
trie implements.

## The representation

Everything rests on one observation.  A `pathmap` trie is **not** just a
path→value map: `create_path` makes a location that exists without carrying a
value, and `remove_val(false)` leaves one behind.  So a location and a value at
that location are separate facts, and the state records both:

```lean
structure PathMap (V : Type) where
  entries : List (Path × Option V)   -- every location that exists, with its
                                     -- value if it has one
```

One list rather than a path→value map beside a set of existing paths.  The two
halves the API actually observes — `paths` and `vals` — are *derived* from it,
which makes the awkward invariant "every valued path also exists" structural
rather than something every constructor has to maintain: a value cannot be
recorded at a location that is not in the list.  A `none` entry is exactly a
dangling path.  (`PathMap.mem_vals_pathExists` states this as a theorem; it used to
be a runtime check, because in the two-list form it could fail.)

The list is canonical — sorted by path, no duplicates, prefix-closed, containing
`[]` — so **structural equality of `PathMap`s is observational equality**, which is
exactly what is needed to decide `AlgebraicStatus::Identity` versus `Element`.

A location is therefore in one of three states, and asking about it returns all
three at once rather than splitting the question across two accessors:

```lean
inductive Entry (V : Type) | absent | bare | valued : V → Entry V
-- absent ~ Rust's Vacant, valued ~ Occupied, and `bare` is the state a
-- HashMap has no room for: there, but holding nothing.

def entryAt   : PathMap V → Path → Entry V
def valAt      t p := (t.entryAt p).val       -- derived
def pathExists t p := (t.entryAt p).present   -- derived
```

The middle case is where this API keeps going wrong — `create_path` produces it,
`remove_val(false)` leaves it behind, and findings 7, 8 and 15 are all
operations that mishandle it.  A definition written against `Entry` cannot
quietly forget it: the `match` will not compile until it says what happens.  And
`valued` entails existence by construction, so "a value at a path that is not
there" is unrepresentable rather than merely false
(`PathMap.Entry.present_of_val`).

A zipper is that trie plus two paths:

```lean
structure Zip (V : Type) where
  trie : PathMap V   -- the map (a snapshot, for a read zipper; live, for a write zipper)
  root : Path     -- root_prefix_path(): where the zipper was created
  path : Path     -- path(): the relative path to the focus
```

`origin_path() = root ++ path`.  The focus is allowed not to exist — `descend_to`
moves anywhere — so `path` is an unconstrained list of bytes.

Two distinctions the model keeps explicit because `pathmap` depends on them:

* **A node is what lies strictly below a location.**  The value *at* a location
  lives in its parent's cell.  `get_focus`, `graft_internal` and every `*_dyn`
  algebraic primitive operate on nodes, so they never touch the focus value;
  `PathMap.subtrie` includes it, `Zip.focusNode` does not.
* **The `graft_root_vals` feature is on by default**, so `graft`, `graft_map`,
  `make_map`, `take_map`, `join_map_into`, `meet_into` and `subtract_into` handle
  the focus value in a separate step — while `join_into` does not.  The model
  reproduces that asymmetry rather than smoothing it over.

Depth-first traversal order is exactly lexicographic order on paths (a proper
prefix sorts before its extensions), so every iteration primitive is specified
denotationally — "the `Path.lt`-least existing location strictly after the
focus, such that ..." — instead of as a node walk.

## Layout

| file | contents |
| --- | --- |
| `PathMapModel/Basic.lean` | paths, the prefix and lexicographic orders, `ByteMask`, `ValOps`/`ValRes` (the fragment of `Lattice`/`DistributiveLattice` the trie consumes, including the left-biased `u64` instance), `AlgebraicStatus` |
| `PathMapModel/PathMap.lean` | what a trie *means*: the flat representation, its observations, sub-tries and grafting, point updates, pruning, and the trie-level `join` / `meet` / `sub` / `prestrict` / `drop_head` |
| `PathMapModel/Zipper.lean` | the read API: `trait Zipper`, `ZipperValues`, `ZipperMoving`, `ZipperIteration`, `ZipperForking`, `ZipperAbsolutePath` |
| `PathMapModel/Write.lean` | the write API: `ZipperWriting` in full |
| `PathMapModel/Map.lean` | the `PathMap` surface, which is the zipper API applied at the root — plus `PathMap::restrict`, the one genuinely map-level operation |
| `PathMapModel/Spec.lean` | §1 proved laws (the cursor algebra); §2 checkable laws (metamorphic properties) |
| `PathMapModel/Check.lean` | `#guard`s: regression fixtures transcribed from `src/write_zipper.rs`'s own tests, and the §2 laws over a battery of tries |
| `PathMapModel/Fuzz.lean` | the wire format, the operation table, and the trace producer (including `--act` mode) |
| `Main.lean` | the `pathmap-oracle` binary |

## What is proved versus what is checked

Honest accounting, because it matters for how much the model is worth:

* **Proved** (`Spec.lean` §1): the cursor algebra — `descend_to` is a monoid
  action of paths on zippers, ascending exactly as far as you descended is the
  identity, ascending past the root stops at the root and reports failure,
  movement never mutates the trie, `origin_path = root_prefix_path ++ path`,
  `child_count = |child_mask|`, and `prune_path` never removes more bytes than
  separate the focus from its stop depth.
* **Machine-checked on fixtures** (`Check.lean`): the metamorphic laws in
  `Spec.lean` §2, evaluated at build time over six trie shapes crossed with
  eight focus positions — plus regression fixtures whose expected values are
  transcribed from `pathmap`'s own unit tests (`write_zipper_prune_path_test2`,
  `write_zipper_drop_head_test1/3/6`) and the `restrict` oracle from
  `tests/pathmap_algebra_differential.rs`.
* **Checked against the crate** (`differential.py`): everything else, on every
  generated program.

The definitions themselves are the specification.  They are total and executable,
so "the spec" and "the oracle" cannot drift apart.

## The differential harness

A fuzzer input is a byte string.  Lean and Rust decode it with identical rules
into a program over two maps and two zippers — `wz` writing into map 0, `rz`
reading map 1, kept in separate maps so the real crate can hold both at once.

```
header:
  n  := u8 % 8                              -- entries seeded into map0
  n × ( len := u8 % 6 ; len × pathbyte ; val := u8 )
  n  := u8 % 8                              -- entries seeded into map1
  n × ( len := u8 % 6 ; len × pathbyte ; val := u8 )
  r0 := u8 % 4 ; r0 × pathbyte              -- write zipper root
  r1 := u8 % 4 ; r1 × pathbyte              -- read  zipper root
body:
  repeated: op := u8 % 56 ; operands per op
```

Every path byte is masked to `b % 4`, so generated tries share prefixes heavily
and actually branch — that is where the interesting shapes are (branch points,
single-child runs, dangling chains).  Decoding stops when the input runs out.

Each operation appends one line carrying its return value and a fingerprint of
both zippers (relative path, origin path, existence, value, child count, value
count); the run ends with a full dump of both maps.  Any behavioural difference
is a textual diff.

The op table lives in `Fuzz.lean` (`PathMapModel.Fuzz.step`) and
`differential/src/harness.rs`; **the two must be changed together.**

### Front ends

| binary | drives | built with |
|---|---|---|
| `lean/.lake/build/bin/pathmap-oracle` | the Lean model | `cd lean && lake build` |
| `target/release/pathmap_trace` | the real crate | `cargo build --release -p differential` |
| `target/release/act_trace` | the crate, ACT read source | `cargo build --release -p differential` |

`differential.py` diffs the Lean oracle against one of the others:

```bash
./lean/differential.py --random 500            # Lean model vs. the crate
./lean/differential.py --act   --random 500    # Lean model vs. an ACT read source
```

### Resident children

Each front end is spawned once with `--server` and stays up, taking inputs as
hex on stdin — `run-input <timeout-ms> <hex>`, replying with the trace and one
`!DONE` / `!TIMEOUT` / `!PANIC <msg>` terminator.  The protocol lives in
`differential/src/server.rs`, shared by both crate front ends (it is plumbing;
it knows nothing about tries).

This replaced a temp file plus two fresh processes per input.  Process creation
dominated: 2000 inputs took 10.3s wall with 6.4s of that in `sys`, and now take
1.8s with 0.7s in `sys` — 5.6x faster overall, 10x less kernel time.  The old
scheme also never deleted its temp directories; 98M of `/tmp/pathmap-diff-*` had
accumulated.  Only failing inputs are written out now, and the path is printed
so `shrink.py` can still take them.

Both children are handed an input before either is read, so they work at the
same time; driving them one after the other cost about a fifth of the
throughput.  `-j N` shards across N worker processes, each owning its own pair
of children — processes rather than threads because comparing two lists of trace
lines is enough Python work to make the GIL the ceiling past a few workers.

Where an input *comes from* is behind `InputSource`, and each worker asks for
its own through `get_next_input(idx)`.  `get` must be deterministic in `idx` and
carry no state between calls, which is what makes a `-j32` run test exactly what
a `-j1` run does and lets the parent re-derive a failing input from its index
without workers shipping bytes back.  `RandomInputs` seeds per index rather than
once per run, so generation parallelises; a queue-backed source (a corpus being
minimised, a coverage-guided generator) drops in without touching the driver.

That mattered more than it sounds.  The parent used to build every random input
up front, single-threaded, a byte at a time — `bytes(rng.randrange(256) for _ in
range(n))` — which was 0.63s per 20000 inputs, half the wall clock of a `-j32`
pass, and it capped scaling at `-j32`.  `randbytes` alone is ~39x faster than
that loop, and moving it into the workers removes it from the critical path:

    inputs/s, 100000 random programs

              -j1      -j8     -j32     -j64
    model    1746    12376    37037    44444
    crate       -        -    36232    45249

Crate mode is the slow one — 897/s at `-j32`, because two hangs per 2000
inputs each stall for the whole timeout and no amount of parallelism goes below
that floor.  The hangs are the read zipper's missing at-root guard (finding 3);
until that is fixed, the timeout is the floor.

Note that changing the generator changed *which* programs a seed produces, so
runs recorded against an older seed do not reproduce byte for byte.

`--timeout` bounds one input, and defaults to 2s.  It used to be 30s, which was
about 25000x too generous: measured over 2000 random programs against the real
crate, the inputs that do *not* hang run in p50 0.19ms and p100 1.21ms.  Since
two of those 2000 do hang, that one constant was most of the wall clock — crate
mode went from 32 to 364 inputs/s at `-j1` on the strength of it, and 897/s at
`-j8`, where the remaining floor is just the timeout itself.

The Rust front ends run each input on a thread they can abandon, so a hang costs
one input rather than the process.  The driver then respawns that child anyway:
an abandoned thread cannot be killed and goes on spinning at 100% of a core for
the rest of the run, which showed up as `user` time exceeding `wall` on an
otherwise sequential workload.  A respawn costs ~3ms and gets the core back.
The oracle cannot cut its own work off at all: `IO.asTask` with `IO.waitAny`
blocks on the work task and never sees the timer, and polling `IO.hasFinished`
blocks on the first call (measured: a 50ms budget returned "finished" after
99.5s).  So the driver enforces that deadline from outside, killing and
respawning a child that stops answering — which it must handle anyway, since no
in-process timeout saves a child that has died outright.

### From a failing input to a reproducer

A divergence arrives as a `.bin` and a trace diff, which still leaves the repro
to be written by hand -- and the interesting ones are forty operations into a
trie built by forty earlier ones.  `--repro` turns the input back into a
standalone Rust program that uses only the public `pathmap` API:

```bash
cargo run --release -p differential --bin pathmap_trace -- --repro FILE            # whole program
cargo run --release -p differential --bin pathmap_trace -- --repro --upto 15 FILE  # through step 14
```

`--upto N` stops after N operations, so a trace line `14 to_next_val ...` is
reproduced by `--upto 15`.  Shrink first (`shrink.py`) and the result is usually
a handful of calls, ready to paste into `differential/src/bin/zipper_bug_repros.rs`.

The generator decodes the same bytes in the same order as the op table,
including the operands consumed only to keep the stream aligned, so it is worth
compiling and running rather than trusting: a generated repro that has drifted
from the op table will not reproduce.  Both checks are done -- the repro for an
input that panics the crate reproduces the same panic, and for inputs that do
not, the maps it ends with match the trace's `MAP0`/`MAP1`.

### Deliberately skipped operations

A handful of argument combinations are skipped by both sides, each because the
crate's behaviour there is a confirmed bug that would otherwise mask everything
downstream.  Each is recorded in [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) and each skip is
commented at its site:

* `meet_k_path_into` when the focus has no children, or `k = 0` — it does not
  terminate.
* `insert_prefix("")` and `join_k_path_into(0)` — both should be the identity and
  both destroy the subtrie.
* `descend_first_k_path(0)` / `to_next_k_path(0)` — degenerate; report success
  without moving, forever.
* `to_next_sibling_byte` / `to_prev_sibling_byte` at the zipper root — the native
  read zipper leaves its own root there.
* `prune_path` / `prune_ascend`, and the `prune` flag on every other operation,
  for a write zipper not rooted at the map root — the depth pruned is a function
  of internal node layout, so there is nothing to specify.

`to_next_k_path` is also only exercised as the continuation of a
`descend_first_k_path` iteration (the `k_path_walk` op), because
`k_path_internal` carries iteration state and `pathmap`'s own debug assertions
flag calling it cold.

Five return values are compared as `?` when the focus has no descendants
(`remove_branches`, `join_map_into`, `restrict`, `restricting`, `take_map`):
they report on whether an empty node happens to be materialised at the focus,
which is representation state rather than trie state.  The *effects* are still
compared in full.

## The blind-zipper contract

The model follows master's blind-zipper contract, where `ZipperMoving` no longer
provides `path()`.  A zipper that does not track its own path is *blind*;
`path()` and `move_to_path()` moved to a separate `ZipperPath: ZipperMoving`
trait, which the concrete `ReadZipper`/`WriteZipper` types still implement.

What that cost the model, in full:

* **`Zipper.lean` gained `focusByte`** — the only positional information a blind
  zipper can read.  Its value at the root is *unspecified* by the trait, so the
  harness masks it there (`f?` in the trace) and compares it everywhere else.
* **The movement operations report distance or destination, not a flag.**
  `ascend`, `ascend_until` and `ascend_until_branch` return the number of bytes
  ascended; `descend_indexed_byte`, `descend_first_byte`, `descend_last_byte`,
  `to_next_sibling_byte` and `to_prev_sibling_byte` return the `Option<u8>` byte
  they moved to.  `ascend_byte` survives as `ascend(1) == 1`.
* **`descend_until_observed` is new**, and is the interesting addition: a blind
  zipper learns where it went only from what the operation reports to a
  `PathObserver`.  The model specifies the reported sequence as the path delta,
  the harness runs it as op 47 with a `Vec<u8>` observer and compares it byte for
  byte, and `Laws.descendUntilObservedExact` states the property.

`ZipperWriting`, `Zipper` and `ZipperValues` are unchanged, so `PathMap.lean`,
`Write.lean` and `Map.lean` needed nothing.  Two proved laws were restated
around the new return types, and one was added — `ascend_accounts`, that the
count `ascend` reports is exactly the depth the focus lost, which is what a
blind caller has to rely on.

## Is the specification just a copy of the bugs?

A hand-written model checked against the implementation it was written from has
a specific failure mode: if a defect was **transcribed into the spec**, the two
agree, and the harness reports that agreement as confirmation.  That is worse
than no signal.

Most of the model is not exposed to this — it is derived from trait
documentation (`to_next_val` is "the least existing location after the focus
carrying a value"), from what the types force, or from mathematics (join is
union).  But some of it is not.  Auditing the ~130 definitions, these encode
observed behaviour rather than intent, and are the places to distrust:

| definition | why it is suspect |
| --- | --- |
| `AlgStatus.merge` | transcribed line-for-line from `src/ring.rs` |
| `joinVal` / `meetVal` / `subVal` | follow `Option<V>`'s impls in `src/ring.rs` |
| `Zip.prunePath` | stop depth determined empirically; the doc comment is wrong |
| `Zip.toNextKPath` | deliberately follows the native `ReadZipper` over the trait default |
| `PathMap.dropHead` | "values at depth exactly `k` are lost" is observed, not documented |
| `Zip.joinMapInto` | the short-circuit asymmetry with `join_into` is observed |
| `Zip.meet2` | "never reports `Identity`" comes from a comment in the impl |
| `Check.lean` fixtures | expected values copied from the crate's own passing tests |

**The primary defence is the style the model is written in.**  A definition that
restates its docstring can be checked by reading it; a definition that *simulates
the implementation* has to be executed in your head, and that is where a
transcribed bug hides.  So every operation is written declaratively -- as "the
location such that ...", never as a loop that walks there:

```lean
/-- the next existing location carrying a value, in depth-first order -/
def toNextVal : Bool × Zip V :=
  match z.subPaths.find? (fun q => Path.lt z.path q && (z.trie.valAt (z.root ++ q)).isSome) with
  | some q => (true, { z with path := q })
  | none => (false, z.reset)
```

`subPaths` is in depth-first order, so `find?` *is* "the next one".  The
docstring and the code say the same thing, and no amount of staring at
`ReadZipperCore`'s iterator tokens would change what this definition means.

The same idiom covers ascent -- "the deepest strict ancestor that branches,
carries a value, or is the root" is a `filter` over `Path.properPrefixes`
followed by `getLast?`, not a walk upward.  `descend_until` is "the nearest
descendant that is a value or is not single-childed".  `descend_to_existing` is
"the longest prefix of `k` that still exists", which is well-defined precisely
because existence is prefix-closed.  Nothing in the model recurses with a fuel
bound any more, and nothing computes an index like `p.length - 1 - j`.

This costs efficiency -- several definitions are quadratic where the crate is
constant-time -- and that is the intended trade.  The model is a specification
that happens to run, not an implementation.

Four further defences, in increasing order of how much they actually prove:

**1. Metamorphic laws** (`Spec.lean` §2) relate *different* API functions to each
other — `take_map` then `graft_map` is the identity, `drop_head` undoes
`insert_prefix`, `join` is commutative on paths.  Transcribing one function's
behaviour does not make these hold, so they keep working when the definitions
are contaminated.

**2. Naive oracles** (`Check.lean`) re-derive the same answer from a deliberately
stupid, independent route.  `joinKeysOracle`, `meetKeysOracle` and
`subKeysOracle` say which keys survive using set theory and nothing else — no
`ValOps`, no `PathMap`.  Where they agree with the real definitions, the `ring.rs`
transcription is excluded as a source of error.  This is the same technique the
crate's own `tests/pathmap_algebra_differential.rs` uses for `restrict`, where it
caught a real `prestrict` bug.

**3. A third implementation.**  `ArenaCompactTree` implements the same read
specification independently, so `differential.py --act` triangulates: the model
agreeing with `PathMap` while disagreeing with ACT is evidence the model is not
merely echoing either one.  It found three ACT defects.

**4. Mutation testing** (`lean/mutate.py`) measures sensitivity directly rather
than arguing for it.  It injects a deliberate defect
into `pathmap`, rebuilds, and re-runs the differential over a fixed corpus:

```bash
./lean/mutate.py                 # the whole set in lean/mutants.toml
./lean/mutate.py --only ascend   # one group
```

A mutant is **killed** if the differential's verdict changes, and **SURVIVED**
if the crate demonstrably behaves differently yet the verdict does not move —
which is precisely what a transcribed bug looks like from the outside.  Mutants
whose traces are byte-identical to baseline are reported as **equivalent**: the
corpus never reaches them, which is a coverage fact, not a spec failure.
Comparing whole verdicts rather than pass counts means the defects already in
FINDINGS.md cannot mask a mutant.

A first run over `lean/mutants.toml` killed 6 of 6 behaviour-changing mutants
with no survivors -- but 9 of the 15 came back `equivalent`, meaning the corpus
never reaches them, and most of those sit in `ring.rs`, which is exactly where
the transcription risk is concentrated.  So that run is *inconclusive* about the
suspect definitions rather than reassuring about them, and it says more about the
31% line coverage of `ring.rs` than about the spec.  Raising algebraic coverage
would make the technique bite where it is most needed.

What none of this can do is prove the specification *right*.  It can only show
that the specification is not vacuous in a given region, and narrow the set of
places where "the model and the crate agree" might mean "they are wrong
together".  Every survivor is a place to go and re-derive the definition from the
documentation rather than from the code.

## Current agreement

500 random programs (`./lean/differential.py --random 500 --seed 99 --max-fails 0`),
model versus crate, comparing every return value plus both maps in full:

```
404/500 inputs agree exactly
 87/500 hit one of the classified defects in FINDINGS.md
  9/500 diverge for reasons not yet classified
```

The 87 break down as: `to_next_val` after `to_next_step` (19), `ascend_until`
corrupting a write zipper (17), zippers escaping their root (16), a `set_val`
unwrap on `None` (14), the `TrieRef` slice underflow (12), `make_unique` on an
empty sentinel (7), `join_into` dropping the source (2).

Every defect listed in FINDINGS.md reproduces here exactly as it does on
`master`; the blind-zipper migration neither fixed nor introduced any of them.

`differential.py` prints that breakdown itself, so new divergences stay visible
as the known ones are fixed.

## ArenaCompactTree as the read source

`ArenaCompactTree` is a second implementation of the same *read* specification,
so the model can hold it to the same standard without any new modelling:

```bash
cargo build --release -p differential
./lean/differential.py --act --random 500 --seed 99 --max-fails 0
```

`differential/src/bin/act_trace.rs` builds an ACT from map1 with `from_zipper` and runs the
identical operation table against an `ACTZipper`.  There is still exactly one
op table: the merge operations sit behind a `ReadSource` trait, whose ACT
implementation declines them, so the two front ends cannot drift apart.  The
model's matching mode is `pathmap-oracle --act`.

ACT is read-only, and more restrictively is not a `ZipperInfallibleSubtries`, so
it cannot be the *source* of a graft or an algebraic merge; those operations and
`make_map` report `skip` on both sides.  Everything else is compared in full,
including the final trie -- which is dumped *from the ACT*, so `from_zipper` is
under test on every program.

```
248/500 inputs agree exactly
250/500 hit a classified defect (three of them ACT-specific)
  2/500 diverge for reasons not yet classified
```

Three ACT defects, all silent wrong answers, are written up in FINDINGS.md:
`val_count()` counts from the zipper root rather than the focus (117 of 500
programs), `descend_first_k_path()` only walks the leftmost chain, and
`descend_last_path()` can run one byte past the end of the trie.  `from_zipper`
round-trips faithfully, and `merge_zipper_into_file` -- ACT's one write-shaped
operation -- matches its specification on all 300 cases of
`differential/src/bin/act_merge_check.rs`.

## Sharing

`pathmap` is a DAG: subtries are shared between paths, `graft` clones a
refcounted pointer rather than the data, and writes go through copy-on-write.
**The model has no notion of nodes at all** — a `PathMap` is a flat map from paths
to entries, so grafting the same subtrie into two places yields two independent
copies by construction, and sharing is invisible.

That is deliberate.  Sharing is an implementation strategy, not part of the
meaning, and the crate says so itself about the two methods that expose it:
`shared_node_id` "is not stable across runs", and of `is_shared`, "your code
must never rely on the return value for correctness".  Specifying them would
mean specifying non-determinism, so `ZipperConcrete` is out of the harness.

Nothing is refused: a write whose focus lies inside a shared subtrie goes
through, and the sharing is dissolved as it happens.  `make_unique` compares the
refcount and clones when it is not 1, so the node stops being shared at the
moment of the write — `is_shared` at the written location goes `true` → `false`
while the other reference keeps the original node.  Copy-on-write, not a
restriction.

Not modelling sharing is what makes sharing bugs *detectable* rather than what
hides them: the model says two grafted copies are independent, so a mutation
leaking from one to the other is a divergence.  Where representation does leak
into observable results, that is a finding — 8, 14, 15 and 16 all are.

Two properties the differential harness cannot reach are checked directly:

```bash
cargo run -p differential --bin sharing_check
```

* **Copy-on-write** — graft one source into three places, write under one, and
  the others must be untouched.
* **`merkleize`** — the one operation whose purpose is to *change* sharing, so
  the one place the model's blind spot is deliberately exercised.  The
  observable trie must survive unchanged.

Both hold wherever they run (266/266 and 214/214, 1464 node references reused)
and both abort on tries containing a *shared dangling path* — see finding 16.

## Structural invariants

`pathmap_trace --check <file>` (and `act_trace --check`) asserts structural
invariants in-process after every operation — no oracle needed:

* `at_root()` agrees with `path().is_empty()`
* `origin_path() == root_prefix_path() ++ path()`
* `root_prefix_path()` never changes — **a zipper may not escape its own root**
* a value implies the path exists; children imply the path exists
* `child_count() == |child_mask()|`
* `val_count()` counts the focus value, and equals it exactly at a leaf

`differential.py` runs without `--check`, because a crate that violates an
invariant should show up as a trace diff rather than as an abort.

## Out of scope

`ZipperHead` and the concurrency story, `ProductZipper` / `PrefixZipper` /
`OverlayZipper` / the ACT format, serialisation, `merkleize`, catamorphisms, and
allocator behaviour.  The model covers `PathMap`, `ReadZipper` and `WriteZipper`
over an in-memory trie.

That said, the containment invariant `--check` asserts
(`root_prefix_path()` never changes) is exactly the property `ZipperHead` relies
on to hand out non-overlapping zippers safely, and it is violated — see
[FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md).
